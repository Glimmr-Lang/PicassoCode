## About

Piccasso code is an image editor that uses code to create/edit an image. This allows powerful designs to be created with ease and
automation. The editor uses _glimr_ as the scripting language for writing the image editing code.

## Inspired by

Piccassocode is heavily inspired by the [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) program and tries to mimic its functionality
as much as it can while still being an image editor. I was stoked when I tried OpenSCAD for the first time and ended up
challenging myself to start a new project based around the idea. A friend suggested something that has to do with graphics
and my first though was OpenSCAD, but 2D. The idea quickly grew and the small program became an image editor.
