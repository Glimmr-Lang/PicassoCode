### `function drawImage(id=0, x=0, y=0, w=10, h=10)`
- Draws an image to the screen.

###### Arguments
- `id` - The identifier of the image resource to draw. Defaults to `0`. This ID likely corresponds to an image loaded through a resource loading mechanism.
- `x` - The x-coordinate of the top-left corner where the image will be drawn. Defaults to `0`.
- `y` - The y-coordinate of the top-left corner where the image will be drawn. Defaults to `0`.
- `w` - The width at which the image will be drawn. Defaults to `10`.
- `h` - The height at which the image will be drawn. Defaults to `10`.

###### Returns
- This function likely performs a drawing operation and may not explicitly return a value. The return type would depend on the underlying implementation (`pic_nat_drawimage`). It might return a status code or nothing at all.
